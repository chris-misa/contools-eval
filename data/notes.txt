(using linux bridge)

last run (1477 containers) ran into bridge overflow:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint ping-container1477 on network bridge: adding interface veth700eb8e to bridge docker0 failed: exchange full.
```

There seems to be a latency spike in the 6 trials before this.
