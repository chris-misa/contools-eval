(using linux bridge)

20190107012837:


last run (1477 containers) ran into bridge overflow:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint ping-container1477 on network bridge: adding interface veth700eb8e to bridge docker0 failed: exchange full.
```

There seems to be a latency spike in the 6 trials before this.


20190107134045: (~100 per run)
20190107184349: (~500 per run)

Seemingly linear increase in latency as containers increase from 10 to 300.



Gopher-net is not removing veths when containers are removed and the iface pool is getting saturated.
