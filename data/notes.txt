(using linux bridge)

20190107012837 (at -i 1):


last run (1477 containers) ran into bridge overflow:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint ping-container1477 on network bridge: adding interface veth700eb8e to bridge docker0 failed: exchange full.
```

There seems to be a latency spike in the 6 trials before this.


20190107134045: (~100 per run, all at -i 1)
20190107184349: (~500 per run, all at -i 1)

Seemingly linear increase in latency as containers increase from 10 to 300.



Gopher-net is not removing veths when containers are removed and the iface pool is getting saturated.
Or, gopher-net just can't deal with more the c.a. 60 containers. . .


20190108160600: (Each container pinging at 1 pps)

Since each container competes for network, greater effect on latency.



20190109005654: (Different topologies with all at -i 0)

Slight increase when traffic also goes through bridge.


20190109000513:
OVS with docker-compose integration:
0 to 60 at 1000 samples each (-i 1.0)

Hard to tell from limited sample range, but seems like the same trend. . .



20190109010656:
-i 0 from 0 to 500 containers on linux bridge network.

Seems like no increase, probably due to caching in the bridge / iptables.


20190109110515:
-i 0, 0 to 500 containers on linux bridge with other containers
pinging at -i 1.0

Instructions per packet?
